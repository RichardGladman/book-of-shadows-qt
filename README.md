To install, the book of shadows, you can either download the Linux binary from the [releases](https://github.com/RichardGladman/book-of-shadows-qt/releases) page, or preferably build it from source. In either case, you will need Qt 6.9 or later.

To build from source, run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/RichardGladman/book-of-shadows-qt.git
cd bool-of-shadows-qt
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
